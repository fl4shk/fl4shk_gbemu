============

Incomplete GB (and eventually GBC) emulator.  Currently there is CPU emulation
(not counting bugs it should be complete), interrupt emulation, LCD emulation 
(which might also contain bugs), and OAM DMA functionality.

For graphics rendering and sound playing, I will be using SFML 2.0 (that means
it's a dependency!).
