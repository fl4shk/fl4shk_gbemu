Some version of g++ that supports gnu++0x is recommended to compile this.  I have 
not tried to compile this project with any other compilers, but it might be possible.

SFML 2.0 is a dependency (along with whatever its dependencies are).  Linux Mint 15 
and Ubuntu 13.04 do not ship with SFML 2.0 in their repositories.  If you are using 
either of those distros, you will probably have to compile it yourself.

The following guide is easy to use for compiling SFML 2.0 on recent Linux distros.  I have only done this on Linux Mint 13 and Linux Mint 15, but doing this on other distros should be easy.
